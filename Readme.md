# Network Monitoring System: Project Overview

## 1. Introduction

**Purpose:**
The Network Monitoring System is a software application designed to continuously observe and record various aspects of network activity and performance. Its primary goal is to provide insights into network health, identify potential issues proactively, and maintain a historical record of network events for analysis and troubleshooting.

**Problem Solved:**
In any networked environment, understanding traffic patterns, identifying bottlenecks, detecting anomalies, and ensuring reliability are crucial. This system aims to automate the collection and logging of vital network data, making it easier for administrators and developers to manage and maintain network infrastructure efficiently.

## 2. Core Functionalities

The system is envisioned to have the following core capabilities:

*   **Network Data Collection:**
    *   Monitor network traffic (e.g., bandwidth usage, data packets).
    *   Track network performance metrics (e.g., latency, packet loss).
    *   Detect and log network errors or unusual events.
*   **Comprehensive Logging:**
    *   Maintain detailed logs of all monitored activities and significant network events.
    *   Ensure logs are timestamped and structured for easy querying and analysis.
    *   Provide different log levels (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR) to categorize the severity of events.
*   **Configuration Management:**
    *   Allow users to configure monitoring parameters, such as target network interfaces, monitoring intervals, and alert thresholds (future).
*   **Data Persistence & Management:**
    *   Store collected data and logs reliably.
    *   Implement mechanisms for managing log data over time to prevent excessive disk usage (see Log Rotation).

## 3. Key Feature: Log Rotation (Implemented via SCRUM-10)

**What it is:**
As the system runs, it generates log files. Over time, these files can grow very large, consuming significant disk space and potentially slowing down log access. Log rotation is a mechanism that automatically manages these log files.

**How it works (Non-Technical Explanation):**
Think of it like a diary that has a limited number of pages. Once the current diary (log file) is full (reaches a set size), the system:
1.  Closes the current "full" diary.
2.  Renames it (e.g., adds a number like `.1` to its name) and archives it.
3.  Starts a fresh, new diary for ongoing entries.
4.  To save space, it only keeps a certain number of old diaries (e.g., the last 5). When a new diary is archived, if the limit of old diaries is exceeded, the oldest one is discarded.

**Benefits for Developers & System Health:**
*   **Prevents Disk Full Scenarios:** Ensures the system doesn't crash or stop logging due to running out of disk space.
*   **Maintains Performance:** Smaller log files are generally faster to access and search.
*   **Organized Log Management:** Keeps log data manageable and organized over time.
*   **Configurability:**
    *   The maximum size for a log file before it's rotated is configurable (default: 10MB).
    *   The number of old log files to keep is configurable (default: 5 backup files).

## 4. Target Users

*   **System Administrators:** To monitor network health and troubleshoot issues.
*   **Network Engineers:** To analyze network performance and plan capacity.
*   **Developers (of this system):** To understand the operational context and requirements for new features or bug fixes.

## 5. Future Considerations (Examples)

*   Real-time alerting for critical network events.
*   A user interface or dashboard for visualizing network data.
*   More sophisticated data analysis capabilities.
